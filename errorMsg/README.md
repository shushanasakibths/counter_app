# errorMsg

**Challenge**

When the user clicks the purchase button, render out "Something went wrong, please try again" in the paragraph that has the id="error".

Note: index.html does not have a folder called 'images'. the image shoe.jpeg is linked directly. However, you can create a folder for the image if you wish.
